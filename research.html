				<h3>Mesoscale Oeanic Variability from Satellite Altimetry</h3>
				<p>
					Satellite altimetry has revolutionized our understanding of oceanic processes yet the spatial resolution
					of the sea surface height is generally limitted by the wide cross-track spacing (~100km). Here we use both
					non-repeat and repeat altimeter data (from Geosat, Envisat, Jaon-1/2, Cryosat-2, SARAL/Altika and Sentinel-3)
					to explore sea surface variations for wavelength from 30 to 200 km. </br></br>
					We present surface slope variations with respect to the best mean slope map (version name V28). 
					The latter is what geophysicists are interested in while the former serves as noise. By projecting best mean slopes
					to north and east directions, we can construct gravity anomaly in the vertical direction then transfer it
					to seafloor topography. 
					However, for oceanographers, slope variabilities show detailed oceanic signals that are associated with 
					geostrophy, tides and internal waves.</br></br>
					We construct along track slope to "whiten" the power spectra of
					along track slope profiles. We band-pass filter each profile to show oceanic variability at different spatial scales.
					The slope variability maps we present do not have temporal variation but with spatial resolution of up to 30 km.</br></br>
					Right figure: slope variability in the 160-180km band from multi-altimetry mission showing internal tides radiating
					away from generation sites of rough topography/strong stratification in the pacific, Amazon shelf and Madagascar.

				<h3>Ocean Swells Observed in ICESat-2 photon height data</h3>
				<p> 
					ICESat-2 was launched in September 2018 and it uses light to measure height. 
					It has a single laser, split into six beams of green lights and arranged in three pairs.
					ICESat-2 is able to image individual waves with a footprint of 14m, much smaller than the 10km 
					footprint of traditional microwave band radar altimetry.</br></br>
					We study the power spectra of photon height to understand the spatial variability of sea surface height 
					in different scales (down to 30m) and to understand the behavior of traditional radar altimetry.
					Ocean swells on the spatial scale of around 200m are missing in trational altimter missions. 
					By studying the coherence between a weak and strong beam pair that seperated by 90 m,
					we are able to construct the direction and wavelength of swells. 
					We also investigate the spatial variations in significant wave height for waveform retracking purpose.</br></br> 
					Left figure: a representative power spectra of photon height measurement in the equatorial Pacific,
					showing a swell peak around 300 m (with an angle to the propogation direction), fast decaying energy 
					at shorter wavelength and increasing energy at long wavelength (>100km).

				<h3>Variations of the Argentine Gyre observed by GRACE and Ocean Altimetry</h3>
				<p> 
					The Argentine Gyre is a persistent, energetic mesoscale circulation in the south Atlantic Ocean. 
					We study its nonseasonal variability by analyzing data from the satellite mission GRACE that measures 
					the time-variable gravity, in conjunction with the ocean altimetry and two ocean general circulation model outputs. 
					We Found that the Argentine Gyre undulates up-and-down in sea level variation temporally in pace with 
					the Antarctic Oscillation, which is not verified before. 
					We also confirm the existence of a high-frequency rotary oscillation within the gyre at ~25-day periodicity. 
					We demonstrate that GRACE is sensitive enough to detect oceanographic signals at spatial and temporal resolutions 
					higher than practiced hitherto.

					in the GRACE time‐variable gravity and ocean altimetry measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 123(8),

					Note: This work was done when I was visiting the Academia Sinica in Taipei during my master's study. I basically
					worked on GRACE applications (see CV: publication for details on J2 and earthquake) for my master's reseach. It was the first time that I got to 
					know a little bit about ocean science. Later it turned out that I'll be studying ocean, 
					sitting in an office 2-mintue away from beach for my PhD!
