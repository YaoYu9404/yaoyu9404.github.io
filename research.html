		<h2>Variations of the Argentine Gyre observed by GRACE and Ocean Altimetry</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/research/Argentine1.png" alt="" style="max-width: 40%;" />
		</p>
		<p> The Argentine Gyre is a persistent, energetic mesoscale circulation in the south Atlantic Ocean. 
			We study its nonseasonal variability by analyzing data from the satellite mission GRACE that measures 
			the time-variable gravity, in conjunction with the ocean altimetry and two ocean general circulation model outputs. 
			We Found that the Argentine Gyre undulates up-and-down in sea level variation temporally in pace with 
			the Antarctic Oscillation, which is not verified before. 
			We also confirm the existence of a high-frequency rotary oscillation within the gyre at ~25-day periodicity. 
			We demonstrate that GRACE is sensitive enough to detect oceanographic signals at spatial and temporal resolutions 
			higher than practiced hitherto.

			<p>
				This work was done when I was visiting the Academia Sinica in Taipei during my master's study. 
				It was the first time that I got to know a little bit about ocean science.
