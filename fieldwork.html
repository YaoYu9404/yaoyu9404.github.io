		<h3>GPS survey at Ridgecrest (Nov. 10-11, 2019)</h3>
		<p>I will never forget this field trip as I was dehydrated. I felt cold under the burning sun, threw up in desert and a Starbucks. 
			Thanks to those who took care of me. It was terrible feeling. Be sure to drink enough water and energy drink in desert.
