		<h3>R/V Sally Ride at Fieberling seamont chains (Jan 13-23, 2020)</h3>
		<p>
			This was my first cruise experience. <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/sally-ride">R/V Sally Ride</a> is a medium size modern research vessle
			that can hold 20 crew and 25 scientists. UCSD has a fascinating ship funds program that every student, stuff and faculty member can apply and
			there is an opportunity to get funded to perform a ~10 day cruise survery. 
			The ferbieling survey was offered as a class. 20ish Scripps peeps (me included) and two faculty adults joined it.
		</br></br>
		It was a enjoyable trip and also a great chance to build friendship -- we floated, shaked, got sea sickness, ate, slept, worked together on the boat. 
		Sarah M. and Carrie M. were the two chief student scientists. They showed leadship, calmness, encouragement and positive altitude all the time.
		Tricia L. was my roommate and she showed tremendous patience in front of heavy repeated workload. It was amazing to work with them.
		</br></br>
		Food was fabulous, so were snacks. Couldn't imagine that I can enjoy American food for ten days, yet I did. I learned that a toilet is called a "head"; ginger tea is amazing in curing sea sickness; sea water is really salty.
		I also experienced a lot of first times:
		first time to draw and shrank cups with CDT cast; first time to cut rocks; first time to see bioilluminium (bonus at the end of the trip);
		first time to filter water to get the microorganism. One more thing: I got lots of forehead acnes on the boat. Still didn't recover after four months :(
		</br></br>
		But I definitely want to go back to sea.
