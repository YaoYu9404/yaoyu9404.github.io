			I am a satellite data person and sitting in front of a computer would be enough. Nooo... Hmmm...
			I need to go out to do field work like a dog needs to take a walk. Sometimes it's just purposeless hanging out for me.
			I am actively involved in field work in southern California. David carries GPS field work like twice a year and I generally would like to join!

		<h3>GPS survey at Ridgecrest (Nov. 10-11, 2019)</h3>
		<p>I will never forget this field trip as I was dehydrated. I felt cold under the burning sun, threw up in desert and a Starbucks. 
			Thanks to those who took care of me. It was terrible feeling. Be sure to drink enough water and energy drink in desert.
